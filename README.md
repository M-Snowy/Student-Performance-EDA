### Student Performance Exploratory Data Analysis
https://github.com/M-Snowy/Student-Performance-EDA/blob/main/Students%20Perfomance%20data%20EDA.sql

### Project Objectives
The goal of this analysis is to examine student performance data to identify key factors that influence academic success. By applying data cleaning, and  exploratory data analysis (EDA), the goal is to uncover meaningful patterns and insights that can guide interventions to improve student outcomes.

### Dataset description
This dataset contains student academic records to analyze  performance trends, study habits, and influencing factors.

### Potential Use Cases
-	Examine  student performance based on study habits and attendance.
-	Identifying at-risk students for early intervention.
-	Analyzing the impact  of extracurricular activities on academic success.
-	Exploring the role of parental  education and income in student achievements.
-	Examining  sleep patterns and stress levels affecting student grades.

### Recommendations and insights
-	Encourage Regular Attendance: Since attendance positively impacts final performance, strategies like attendance incentives or participation grades could be introduced.
-	Enhance Study Habits: Promote study strategies that encourage students to study for at least 10-20 hours per week for better performance.
-	Support for Low-Income Students: While income level is not directly correlated with performance, providing academic resources (e.g., free tutoring or online materials) could ensure that financial limitations do not become barriers.
-	Departmental Focus on Performance: Since Computer Science has a larger student population, targeted interventions could be made to enhance engagement and individualized learning approaches.
-	Balance Academics and Extracurricular Activities: While extracurricular participation does not strongly affect performance, structured programs that blend academic and social development should be considered.
